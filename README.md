# Univariate-linear-Regression-Project
In this project the gradient descent algorithm has been built form scracth.  Implementation of  linear regression for one variable names as univarirate to predict a profit for a bike sharing company. For supopose you are a CEO of a bike sharing start up and that you are considering different cities to expand your busines. So your company has already some bikes in different cities and you have the data of population and profits of these cities.ou will now use this data to help you to select the city that whcih city will be next to expand the business.
